                Once more shouting at the top of his lungs, he balanced the tray on his head using his head. "Buy cold water here, buy cold water here." 
 
                A young boy named Tope was seven years old. His father, a banker, passed away when he was three years old while returning home from work. He was unable to make it because of the horrific accident. The family of his father expelled them from the home after calling his mother a witch.
                
                On this same day he was hawking as usual when someone stopped him on the roadside. 
                
                "Hey" the stranger said. 
                
                "Good morning sir." 
                
                Despite having four elder siblings, Tope was the last of the five children. Since it was difficult for their mother, she began a small business where she sells whatever that can sell. His two older siblings have already moved out, claiming they are unable to deal with the burden. 
                
                Tope was unable to attend school, but he always aided his mother in selling products like fruit, water in a bag or bottle, bread, etc.
                
                He was speaking normally when someone stopped him on the side of the road on this particular day. 
                
                "Hey" The stranger said. 
                
                "Good morning, sir." 
                
                "Please, if you can assist me. I only need a sachet of water since I have to go to the interview but a car sprayed water on my clothes and I am unable to go home. I've been walking for a while, but my house is quite a distance away." 
                
                "I'm sorry, sir, but I'm unable to give. My mother will beat me." The young Tope retorted.
                
                The stranger pleaded with him, "Please." 
                
                "I'm sorry, but I can't." 
                
                "Wait up Mr. Stranger," Tope called to the stranger, "I think you need this badly. I'll give you even if my mom beats me," as he offered him two sachets of water. 
                
                "God bless you and I'm so grateful. What's your name?" He enquired.  
                
                Temitope Olanrewaju is the name I go by. Tope responded as he kept hawking.
                .

                .
                A decade afterwards
                
                For the fifth time today, Tope rapped on the company's gate. For the past two weeks, he has been visiting this place. 
                
                They said they needed a cleaner, and he was desperate for the position. On the hospital bed lay his ill mother. According to the doctor, she would have to pay 200,000 naira for her therapy. 
                
                He waited for a bit, and just as he was about to give up and leave, a car drove by and stopped at the gate door. The gateman hurried to the gate to open it as the automobile horn blared.
                
                "Sir, welcome." 
                
                "What boy is that?" The man enquired. 
                
                "He is a gangster who wants to start working as a cleaner here."  
                
                Tope wondered why he would refer to him as a thug. 
                
                "Permit him in, I want to see him." The man replied.
                
                "Okay sir." The gateman responded.
                
                Tope was permitted inside, and as the guy began questioning him, he learned that Tope was the young child who had once helped him when he was in need. 
                
                He settled the medical fees for his mother and adopted Tope as his own child. He delivered on his commitment to send the boy to school. Tope's life altered forever; he was suddenly one of the most powerful figures in the nation. <br>
                
                üìåWhether you sow good or bad, nothing you do will escape your repercussions. <br>
                
                üìåYou will unquestionably get what you sow. Just two sachets of water from Tope changed the man's life for the better. Keep up the good work; it will eventually pay off. <br>
