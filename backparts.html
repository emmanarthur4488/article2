                "I welcome you to my home." Steve  greeted his fiancÃ©e. 
 
                "Thanks, Where is your family?" Josephine said 
                
                "They're upstairs. "
                
                As he climbed the stairs to call his parents and siblings, he said. 
                
                As she awaited them, Josephine sat on the sofa. The moment they all arrived downstairs, her mother-in-law was overjoyed to see her. 
                
                "My darling, you are so gorgeous. I already love you," she remarked. 
                
                "See who we have here." Gloria stated as everyone turned to gaze at her. 
                
                Josephine thought the earth ought to rip open and engulf her. "
                
                "Josephine, my sweetheart, a long time has passed." 
                
                "Do you know her?" His brother enquired. 
                
                "Yes, she was my dorm companion when I was a student. Steve, hold on, is this your fiancÃ©e? no now." 
                
                "Do you recall when I told you that one of my roommates took my foodstuffs  and used it without my permission? She is the one, but you cannot wed her since she is a thief."
                
                "But, Gloria, I told you then," said Josephine. 
                
                "I didn't plan to do it, but I haven't eaten in three days, and although I asked you to give me something, you didn't." 
                
                "You're really silly for saying that. Gloria responded. 
                
                "You have no right to take something that is not yours. When you marry into this family, you will continue to steal since you are a thief"
                
                "I don't want you to enter this house ever again, regardless of how stunning you are. You are a thief." Her mother in law yelled. 
                
                "Don't you hear what mummy said?" Gloria exclaimed as she pulled Josephine out of their home. 
                
                ************************ <br>
                
                Before being able to stop crying, Josephine wept for days. She felt like committing suicide until she found someone who supported her and prayed with her. <br>
                
                ðŸ“ŒNever make fun of someone's backside; you may not be aware of the harm you're causing. <br>
                
                ðŸ“ŒPray for them instead of using their backs against them. There isn't a flawless person in the world; we all have our flaws. <br>
