                I once visited a cosmetics store with a buddy to get hair accessories. 
                At the time, I was actually getting ready for my birthday and intended to visit the studio that day. 
                So, as soon as I walked in, I asked one of the staff members whether they had the specific one I needed. Yes, she replied. 
                I quickly took it and paid for it once she showed me where it was kept because that was just what I needed.
                I just took it and walked out of the store without trying it on. 
                However, guess what? 
                I had just finished getting ready when I arrived to the studio. 
                I took it and intended to use it, but lo and behold, it was broader than my head and didn't fit my hair. 
                I was astonished because I had no idea that it came in different sizes, but I had to use it that way. 
                After my birthday, I gave it to someone; however, when I saw it on her head, I discovered it was large and that she had only used it once before not using it again. 
                When I realized what I had purchased with my own money, it was useless.
                Have you ever purchased something that turned out to be useless for you?
