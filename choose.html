                As mentioned above, “choose” and “chose” are two versions of the same verb—“choose” is present tense” and “chose” is past tense. <br>
                The verb “choose” means to pick out or select something from multiple options. “Chose” is the past tense of “choose,” which means that it has the same meaning, but it indicates that the action occurred in the past rather than the present. <br>
                The key to knowing when to write the word “choose” rather than “chose” is understanding the tense in which you’re writing. <br> 
                Is the action occurring now? Then select “choose.” Has the action already occurred? Then select “chose.” <br>
                Examples of when to use “choose” <br>
                -You need to choose a lipstick to wear. <br>\
                -She chooses the blue car. <br>
                -I hope they choose me as a candidate. <br>
                -We need to choose a vacation destination. <br>
                “Choose” can also be used to describe the future. Use “choose” after an auxiliary verb like “go” or “will” to form the future tense: <br>
                -He will choose a college major next year. <br>
                -I’m going to choose what to order after seeing the menu. <br>
                Examples of when to use “chose” <br>
                -We chose to go to Thailand on vacation. <br>
                -She chose to study physics last semester. <br>
                -I chose to skip my date because I wasn’t feeling well. <br>
                -They chose the winner of the contest. <br>
                To get familiar with using “choose” versus “chose” in your own writing, try writing a few examples yourself. With a little practice, you’ll be an expert on “choose” versus “chose” in no time. <br>
                I'm hoping that you're clear now and won't use "chose" instead of "choose" again.
